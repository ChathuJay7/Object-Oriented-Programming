# Object-Oriented-Programming

## 1 - Classess and Objects
  - A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.
  - An object is an instance of a class. A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. So, an object is the instance(result) of a class. 
## 2 - Constructors
  - constructor initializes an object when it is created. It has the same name as its class and is syntactically similar to a method. However, constructors have no explicit return type.
## 3 - Access Modifiers
  - public
  - private
  - default
  - protected
## 4 - Encapsulation
  - Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.
## 5 - Inheritence
  - Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. 
## 6 - Plymorphism
  - Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
## 7 - Super Keyword
  - Super keyword is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object
## 8 - Method Overloading
  - Method Overloading allows different methods to have the same name, but different signatures where the signature can differ by the number of input parameters or type of input parameters, or a mixture of both.Â 
## 9 - Method Overring
  - Method overriding means if a subclass provides the specific implementation of the method that has been declared by one of its parent class. (subclass has the same method as declared in the parent class)
## 10 - Abstraction
  - Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
  - Abstract class is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class)
  - Abstract method is only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from)
## 11 - Interface
  - Method overriding means if a subclass provides the specific implementation of the method that has been declared by one of its parent class. (subclass has the same method as declared in the parent class)
