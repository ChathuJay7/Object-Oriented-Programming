## 4 - Encapsulation
  - Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.

  - Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
